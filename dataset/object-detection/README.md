For the training phase of the YOLOv8 network for object detection, the version of the dataset generated after annotation, contained in the directory "Peanuts Character Classification.v6i.yolov8" can be employed. This directory includes the models needed for training and all the images, divided into the training, validation and test sets. Each image is associated with a corresponding text file containing the coordinates of the annotation and its class.

The code for execution is integrally included in the "train_object_detection_network.ipynb" notebook. In executing this code, the script "crop_classify_images.py" also available in the project, will be used. In addition, examples of output obtained from the prediction of previously downloaded images in the context of the scraping project are provided.
